        The Hejaz Railway was constructed by the Ottomans between 1900 and 1908, primarily to facilitate pilgrimages to the Muslim Holy places in Arabia. It also served to strengthen Ottoman control over the far flung provinces of their empire. The main line linked Damascus to Medina, over a distance of 1,320km, passing through Transjordan via Az-Zarqa’, Al-Qatranah and Ma’an and into northwestern Arabia to the region of Hejaz where Medina and Mecca are located.
        <br><br>
        The railway replaced the ancient caravan route, which was formerly used to transport goods to and from Damascus and Arabia, a round trip that would have taken approximately four months to complete. The caravan traders were far from happy with this new form of transport as it posed a serious threat to their livelihoods, and many attempts were made by them to disrupt its construction.
        <br><br>
        Within four years of its completion in September 1908, the Hejaz Railway was transporting around 300,000 passengers a year. But these were not only pilgrims – the Turks had started using the railway to transport troops and supplies and, during the World War I (1914-1918), many attempts were made to disrupt it so as to impede the advance of the Turkish Army.
        <br><br>
        Pro-Tip: The railway is currently only for display, but if you’re in Amman and close to the Roman Theatre, you can go squeeze your tush into the elegant Royal Carriage.

Also served as a delicacy, roasted lamb stuffed with rice, chopped onions, nuts and raisins is sure to leave your stomach content.From the Ground Up
        <br><br>
        In the mood to feast like a bedouin? Then you should try Al-Zarb. Jordan boasts a rich bedouin tradition and you can relive a delicious taste of it. Al-Zarb is a lamb dish prepared in a hole dug one metre into ground and coated with bricks to seal in the authentic smokey taste.
        <br><br>
        No matter your preference, Jordanian cuisine will most definitely offer you something to please your taste buds.
        <br><br>
        Pro-Tip: When consuming Mansaf, use the bread and the jameed to pick up the rice and lamb; forming a condensed ball of food in your hand, it makes it a lot neater and Jordanians will be impressed by your technique. Oh yeah, and try to only use one hand. ',

        - Do hold your cup out to signal you would like more.<br>
        
        - Do accept when Arabic coffee is offered to you by your host, as it is a sign of hospitality.<br>
        
        - Do carry plenty of loose change with you, as many Jordanians usually do not carry adequate change.<br>
        
        - Do tip waiters approximately 10% gratuity in addition to the bill (unless a service charge is included in the total bill).<br>
        
        - Do round your taxi fare up to the nearest tenth when paying your driver.<br>
        
        - Do haggle with merchants when shopping.<br>
        
        - Do dress conservatively when exploring public areas of Jordan.<br>
        
        - Do be aware that Arabs tend to stand a fraction of the distance closer when conversing than people do in the West.<br>
        
        - Do feel free to consume alcoholic beverages, but not in outside the appropriate areas.<br>
        
        - Men: Do sit in the front seat of the taxi as it is seen as respectful. <br>
        
        - Women: Do sit in the back seat of a taxi as it is seen as disrespectful.<br>
        
        - Do make space for the elderly and women on public transportation. <br>

            <br>
        - Don\'t openly consume food, beverages, or cigarettes in public places during the holy month of Ramadan.
        <br>
        - Don\'t dress provocatively when walking outdoors.
        <br>
        - Don\'t panic if an acquaintance "pecks" you on the cheeks when greeting you, as Arabs have traditionally kissed each other on both cheeks as a warm gesture of welcome and affection.
        <br>
        - Don\'t feel uncomfortable if your host insists on "over feeding" you during a meal, as Arabs traditionally view food as an important symbol of hospitality, generosity, and goodwill – the more the better!
        <br>
        - Don\'t feel that you are required to tip your taxi driver, as tipping in such a scenario is not necessary, but is certainly appreciated.

        /******Religion ******** */

        'parag_religion' => 'Jordan is an ideal destination for those seeking cultural knowledge and spiritual enrichment. Jordan values its ethnically and religiously diverse population, consequently providing for the cultural rights of all its citizens. This spirit of tolerance and appreciation is one of the central elements contributing to the stability and peace  in Jordan. More than 92% of Jordanians are Sunni Muslims and approximately 6% are Christians. The majority of Christians belong to the Greek Orthodox Church; but there are also Greek Catholics, Roman Catholics , Syrian Orthodox, Coptic Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, and a few Protestant denominations. Several small Shi\'a and Druze populations can also be found in Jordan. 
        <br><br>
        As Jordan is predominantly an Islamic country, one may explore the principles of Islam through direct interaction with the people of this monotheistic religion. As the capstone of a long tradition beginning with Judaism and Christianity, Muslims believe that Islam completes the revelation of God\'s message to humankind. Islam – which in Arabic means "submission" – is an assertion of the unity, completeness, and sovereignty of God.  
        <br><br>
        Islamic tradition observes five fundamental creeds, or "pillars," that identify and strengthens the bond of all Muslims . The five pillars consist of:the Confession of Faith, Daily Prayer (five times per day facing Mecca), Fasting during the  holy month of Ramadan, Almsgiving (donating), and the Pilgrimage to Mecca.
        <br><br>
        Pro-Tip: Greeting people with “As-Salamalakium” is very common amongst Muslims and non-Muslims;  and is very friendly way to begin any conversation. So feel free to use it.',

During Ramadan, alcohol is not sold, except  in larger hotels. Smoking, eating, and drinking in public is prohibited during the hours of daylight. As a sign of respect, visitors are kindly requested to refrain from these activities in public during fasting hours. If you’re visiting Jordan during Ramadan and you mistakenly drink or eat in public, don’t worry Jordanians are chill.
            <br><br>
        Pro Tip:  During Ramadan many stores, banks, and offices open  at 09:00 and close early at 14:00. ',
